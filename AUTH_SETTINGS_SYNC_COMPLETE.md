# Auth & Settings Synchronization Complete

## Date: January 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication System Overhauled to Pure JWT
**Problem:** Registration endpoint returned "Unauthorized" because the system was using a hybrid cookie/JWT approach where the middleware expected cookies but registration wasn't being tested with authenticated routes.

**Solution:** 
- **Backend Changes:**
  - Updated `auth/middleware.py` to extract JWT from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header instead of cookies
  - Modified `routes/auth.py` register and login endpoints to return token in response body instead of setting HTTP-only cookies
  - Removed unused `make_response` import
  
- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Updated `lib/api.ts` fetchAPI function to read token from localStorage and send in Authorization header
  - Modified `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to store token in localStorage on login/register
  - Clear token from localStorage on logout

**Files Modified:**
- Backend: `auth/middleware.py`, `routes/auth.py`
- Frontend: `lib/api.ts`, `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

### 2. Complete Settings Backend Implementation
**Problem:** Frontend settings pages (profile, security, notifications) had no backend endpoints to persist data.

**Solution:** Created comprehensive settings routes with proper data persistence:

**New Endpoints Created:**
- `PUT /api/settings/profile` - Update user profile (name, phone, address, preferred_brand)
- `PUT /api/settings/password` - Change password with current password verification
- `PUT /api/settings/security/2fa` - Toggle two-factor authentication with preference merging
- `GET /api/settings/notifications` - Get notification preferences
- `PUT /api/settings/notifications` - Update notification preferences

**Files Modified:**
- Backend: `routes/settings.py` (expanded from 32 to 149 lines)
- Frontend: 
  - `app/dashboard/settings/profile/page.tsx` - Added API integration
  - `app/dashboard/settings/security/page.tsx` - Added password change and 2FA API calls
  - `app/dashboard/settings/notifications/page.tsx` - Added load and save API calls

### 3. Bank Branch Addresses Updated
**Problem:** Bank was only listed as Geneva-based. User requested two branches be added.

**Solution:** Updated all contact information across the application:

**Locations Now Listed:**
- **Headquarters:** Geneva, Switzerland (Rue du Rhône, 1204 Geneva)
- **US Branch:** 5421 N University Dr, Coral Springs, FL 33067, United States
- **Swiss Branch:** Feldstrasse 60, 8180 Bülach, Switzerland

**Phone Numbers:**
- Geneva: +41 22 123 4567
- US: +1 954 555 0100

**Files Modified:**
- `components/Footer.tsx` - Added all locations and US phone number
- `app/privacy/page.tsx` - Updated contact section with all branches
- `app/terms/page.tsx` - Updated contact section with all branches and phones

### 4. Data Persistence Ensured
**Solution:** All settings now properly persist to Supabase database:
- Profile changes update `users` table with `updated_at` timestamp
- Password changes use Supabase auth API for secure updates
- 2FA preferences merge with existing `notification_preferences` JSONB field
- Notification preferences stored in `notification_preferences` JSONB field
- Frontend loads existing preferences on page mount

### 5. Code Synchronization Issues Fixed
**Issues Found and Fixed:**
- Removed unused `make_response` import from `routes/auth.py`
- Fixed 2FA endpoint to merge with existing notification preferences instead of replacing
- Added `useEffect` import to notifications settings page for loading preferences
- Ensured consistent use of `notification_preferences` JSONB field structure

## Database Schema Alignment
All changes align with existing schema (`schema.sql`):
- `users.notification_preferences` (JSONB) - used for all notification and 2FA settings
- `users.address` (JSONB) - properly handled as flexible field
- `users.updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - updated on all modifications

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Auth Flow:** Test registration → stores token → subsequent API calls use token
2. **Settings Persistence:** 
   - Update profile → verify data in database
   - Change password → verify can login with new password
   - Toggle 2FA → verify preference saved
   - Update notifications → verify preferences saved and reload correctly
3. **Beneficiaries:** Already working with proper CRUD operations
4. **Multi-location:** Verify all pages show correct branch information

## Architecture Notes
- **Pure JWT:** More suitable for SPA applications, easier to scale, no CSRF concerns
- **localStorage:** Used for token storage (consider httpOnly cookies for production if XSS is a concern)
- **Notification Preferences:** JSONB field allows flexible schema for various notification types
- **Row Level Security:** All endpoints use `require_auth` decorator ensuring users only access their data

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add token refresh mechanism for expired tokens
2. Implement proper 2FA with TOTP/SMS instead of just preference toggle
3. Add activity logging for security events (password changes, 2FA toggles)
4. Consider moving from localStorage to httpOnly cookies for enhanced security
5. Add rate limiting on auth endpoints
6. Implement email verification for password changes
