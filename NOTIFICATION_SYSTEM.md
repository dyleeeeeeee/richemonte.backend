# Notification System Status

## Current Implementation

### Backend Notification Storage
**File:** `services/notification_service.py`

Notifications are logged to the `notifications` table in Supabase:
```python
async def log_notification(
    supabase: Client,
    user_id: str,
    notification_type: str,
    message: str,
    delivery_method: str = 'email'
) -> None:
    # Saves notification to database
```

### Admin Notification Sending
**File:** `routes/admin.py` - `/api/admin/notifications/send`

Admins can create notifications for specific users:
```http
POST /api/admin/notifications/send
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "type": "admin_message",
  "message": "Your notification message",
  "delivery_method": "push",
  "send_email": false
}
```

This saves the notification to the database with:
- `user_id` - Target user
- `type` - Notification type
- `message` - Notification content
- `delivery_method` - How it should be delivered
- `read` - FALSE by default
- `created_at` - Timestamp

### Email Notifications
**File:** `services/notification_helper.py`

The `notify_user()` function:
1. Logs notification to database (in-app)
2. Checks user notification preferences
3. Sends email if preferences allow

**Supported notification types:**
- `transaction`, `transfer`, `account_created` → Email Transactions preference
- `bill_payment`, `bill_due` → Email Bills preference
- `security`, `login_alert`, `card_issue_reported`, `password_changed` → Email Security preference
- Other types → Send by default

## Real-Time Notifications: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Frontend WebSocket Client
**File:** `ilab/lib/websocket.ts`

The frontend has a WebSocket client ready to connect:
```typescript
wsService.connect("ws://localhost:5000/ws/notifications")
```

Features:
- Auto-reconnection (max 5 attempts)
- Message handler subscription
- Graceful error handling

### Backend WebSocket Server: ❌ MISSING

**Status:** The backend does **NOT** have a WebSocket server implementation.

**Evidence:**
- No WebSocket routes in `app.py`
- No WebSocket blueprint or module
- `grep` search found no WebSocket server code
- Only reference is in documentation markdown file

### Current User Experience

When admin sends notification:
1. ✅ Notification saved to database
2. ✅ Email sent (if preferences allow)
3. ❌ **User does NOT see it in real-time**
4. ❌ **Notification bell does NOT update automatically**
5. ⚠️ User must refresh page or navigate to notifications page

## Implementing Real-Time Notifications

To implement real-time notifications, you need to:

### 1. Install WebSocket Support
```bash
pip install quart-trio  # Or use quart's websocket support
```

### 2. Create WebSocket Route
Create `routes/websocket.py`:
```python
from quart import Blueprint, websocket
from collections import defaultdict

ws_bp = Blueprint('websocket', __name__)
connected_clients = defaultdict(list)  # user_id -> [websocket connections]

@ws_bp.websocket('/ws/notifications')
async def notifications_ws():
    # 1. Authenticate user from token
    # 2. Add to connected_clients
    # 3. Keep connection alive
    # 4. Remove on disconnect
    pass
```

### 3. Broadcast Function
```python
async def broadcast_notification(user_id: str, notification: dict):
    """Send notification to all connected clients for user"""
    if user_id in connected_clients:
        for ws in connected_clients[user_id]:
            try:
                await ws.send_json(notification)
            except:
                # Handle disconnected clients
                pass
```

### 4. Update Admin Notification Route
In `routes/admin.py`, after saving notification:
```python
# After: result = supabase.table('notifications').insert(...).execute()
await broadcast_notification(data['user_id'], result.data[0])
```

### 5. Update All Notification Calls
Any place that calls `log_notification()` or creates notifications should also call `broadcast_notification()`.

### 6. Register WebSocket Blueprint
In `app.py`:
```python
from routes.websocket import ws_bp
app.register_blueprint(ws_bp)
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend is already configured to:
1. Connect to WebSocket on mount (`DashboardLayout.tsx`)
2. Subscribe to notifications
3. Update notification state when messages arrive
4. Show notification badge with unread count

**Frontend Status:** ✅ Ready (just needs backend)

## Current Workaround

Until WebSocket is implemented:
1. Users must manually refresh notifications page
2. Or implement polling (fetch notifications every N seconds)
3. Email notifications work for important alerts

## Comparison

| Method | Real-Time | Server Load | Complexity |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Database Only** | ❌ No | Low | Simple |
| **Polling** | ⚠️ ~5-30s delay | Medium | Simple |
| **WebSocket** | ✅ Instant | Low | Medium |
| **Server-Sent Events** | ✅ Near-instant | Low | Medium |

## Answer to Your Question

> "If admin sends notification, does the user get it in real time in their notification pop up?"

**Answer:** ❌ **NO, NOT CURRENTLY**

The notification is:
- ✅ Saved to database
- ✅ Sent via email (if enabled)
- ❌ **NOT pushed in real-time to frontend**

The user will only see it when they:
- Refresh the page
- Navigate to notifications page
- Or if you implement polling/WebSocket

## Recommendation

For a production banking application, **implement WebSocket server** to provide:
1. Real-time transaction alerts
2. Security notifications
3. Admin messages
4. Account activity updates

This significantly improves user experience and security awareness.

## Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL
Notifications work but are NOT real-time. WebSocket server needs to be implemented.
